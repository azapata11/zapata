											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Prior to beginning college, as many youths find themselves in a similar predicament, I was unclear about what I wanted to do with my future. I knew that I wanted to do something “techy,” but I also wanted to help people, and I was unsure what that truly looked like. I began as an engineering major, and while I enjoyed it, after a few years and an internship at an engineering firm, I could not ignore this gnawing feeling that something was “missing.” Although it was risky and was going to be a huge pay-cut from my prospected future as an engineer, I changed my major to education; specifically, English Language Arts education as I have always adored writing. <br /><br />My career as an educator has felt fulfilling in the sense that I have helped and molded so many minds by creating positive connections with those students. Despite the joyous impacts that I have made with many children, I still deeply crave what I originally wanted, to do something that shares my love of technology. After months of research, I could not believe that there was a potential role for someone like me; a role for someone who loves helping and educating others with complex ideas as well as incorporating that passion for writing that I have always had in a technological space. I have cultivated an understanding of two different types of careers, and I possess the capability to intertwine these two types of careers.<br /><br />

											With my experience from my undergrad in combination with my educational journey, I believe that I can transfer many of those acquired skills onto a new role of a technical writer. Over the past three years between undergrad and my teaching career, I have honed my skills in developing and implementing engaging learning strategies, creating, and maintaining positive relationships with people, as well as tracking and reporting on academic progress. Teaching involves managing groups of people, tracking/reporting student data, and organizing said data to support students. Crafting educational documents and presentations for students using Microsoft Office Suite to assist in their learning process was also integral to communicate key concepts and expectations.<br /><br />
											
											Finally, I believe that my experience attributes well to a technical writer such as the ability to communicate with any clientele and/or stakeholder and effectively communicate complex tasks clearly, as well as balance different assignments simultaneously. In the workplace, I have experienced having to balance multiple things happening at once such as focusing on all the individual needs of students, monitoring progress, taking attendance, taking office calls, responding to emails, grading, etc. Overall, I am looking forward to bringing the lessons I’ve learned working in education to the technical writing space and helping further break down walls in communicating effectively amongst all age groups.<br />
